The modification time of this file is used to compare the
age of the user's config cache with the date of the latest
central config change.

So if you want that all users' config cache files are 
updated, simply do a 'touch rebuild_cache' in this 
directory. When a user invokes tmk the next time, the
config cache will be rebuilt (automatic -reconfig).
